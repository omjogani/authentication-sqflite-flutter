# Flutter Authentication using SQLite


![Banner](https://github.com/omjogani/authentication-sqflite-flutter/blob/master/assets/images/Banner.png?raw=true "Banner")

In this project I have implemented minimalistic User Interface of User Authentication using SQFLite in Flutter. User must be register in order to get authorized in the application. Once User is register then he/she will be able to login with their credentials and use the application. 

All the Data will be stored locally because of SQLite so, once a data of the application got cleared then No user will be able to restore their credentials.

## Packages Used

    sqflite
    flutter_svg 
    path_provider
    path
